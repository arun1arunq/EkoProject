# EkoProject
For learning purposes

This repository was created for the purpose of completing the Mid-Semester Exam (UTS) assignment in the Data Mining course. This project contains the implementation of program code using the Python language developed based on a specific case study that has been determined. All codes, documentation, and folder structures have been arranged in such a way that they are easy to understand, run, and modify by anyone who accesses this repository.

The purpose of this project is to train students' understanding of programming concepts, algorithm logic, and practical application of the theories that have been learned during lectures. This repository also aims to be a learning portfolio that can be accessed publicly via GitHub.

Thank you.
